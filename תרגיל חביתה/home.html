        <h1>Jerusalem etymology</h1>

        <p>
            A city called Rušalim in the Execration texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE) is
            widely, but not universally,
            identified as Jerusalem. Jerusalem is called Urušalim in the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE). The
            name "Jerusalem" is variously
            etymologized to mean "foundation (Sumerian yeru, 'settlement'/Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone')
            of the god Shalem", the god
            Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city. The form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim
            (Jerusalem) first appears in the
            Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of Yhwh Yir'eh ("God will
            see to it", the name given by
            Abraham to the place where he began to sacrifice his son) and the town “Shalem”.
